# 🤝 Join the Fishing Game Community!

Hey there! I'm thrilled you're interested in contributing to this little fishing game. As a solo developer, I welcome any help or ideas you might have. This project is meant to be fun, so let's keep things relaxed and enjoyable!

## 🚀 How You Can Help

2. Create a branch for your idea (`git checkout -b feature/cool-new-fish`)
3. Make your awesome changes
4. Commit them (`git commit -m 'Add super rare rainbow fish'`)
5. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature/cool-new-fish`)

Don't worry about making things perfect - I'm happy to work with you to polish things up!

## 🛠️ Setting Up Your Dev Environment

It's super simple to get started:

1. Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.23 or newer)
2. Clone the repository
3. Get dependencies with `make install-deps`
4. Jump right in with `make run`

## 📁 How the Code is Organized

Here's a quick map to help you find your way around:

- `cmd/fishing/main.go` - Where everything begins
- `cmd/fishing/model.go` - The data structures and styling
- `cmd/fishing/fishing.go` - All the fishing mechanics
- `cmd/fishing/graphics.go` - The visual bits and fish patterns
- `cmd/fishing/views.go` - How everything gets displayed
- `cmd/fishing/background.go` - Stuff that happens in the background
- `game/fish.go` - All about our fishy friends
- `game/player.go` - Player-related code

## 🎨 Style Guide

A few gentle suggestions to keep the code happy:

- Try to follow Go's style - gofmt is your friend!
- Use descriptive names that explain what things do
- Add comments for anything tricky
- If you add new features, consider adding tests too

## 💡 Looking for Ideas?

If you want to contribute but aren't sure where to start, here are some fun possibilities:

- Add new fish species (the weirder the better!)
- Create different fishing spots with unique catches
- Design fishing equipment upgrades
- Build a simple achievement system
- Add sound effects or background music
- Create a stats page with fun graphs
- Improve the save system

Any of these would be amazing additions, but I'm open to your creative ideas too!

## 💬 Questions or Just Want to Chat?
